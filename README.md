# RN-OpenCV-stitching-example
A usage example of OpenCV stitching api in a React native app. For now only iOS is implemented.

To define the camera targets in the environment AR is used with the help of https://github.com/ViroCommunity/viro.

I started by following this tutorial that uses OpenCV to detect blured images, and also used code from this repo :https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch

To run the app :

`yarn install && cd ios && pod install`
